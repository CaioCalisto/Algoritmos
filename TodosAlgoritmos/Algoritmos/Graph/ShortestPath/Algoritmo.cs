    /// <summary>
    /// The shortest path from one vertex to another vertex is a path 
    /// in the graph such that the sum of the weights of the edges that 
    /// should be travelled is minimum.
    /// Applications
    /// - Used to find directions to travel from one location to another 
    ///     in mapping software like Google maps or Apple maps.
    /// - Used in networking to solve the min-delay path problem.
    /// - Used in abstract machines to determine the choices to reach a 
    ///    certain goal state via transitioning among different 
    ///    states(e.g., can be used to determine the minimum possible 
    ///    number of moves to win a game).
